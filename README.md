# Robotica-Bioinspirada
Undulatory locomotion strategies in viscous fluids via Deep Reinforcement Learning (PPO). Using the MuJoCo Swimmer-v5 environment, this project demonstrates an artificial agent's ability to learn efficient swimming patterns from a Tabula Rasa condition, without prior kinematic modeling.
